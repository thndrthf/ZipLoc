# ZipLoc

A streamlined application for accessing and visualizing air quality and weather data. ZipLoc allows users to generate snapshots of AQI and temperature readings for specific locations. With mapping capabilities and graphical outputs, it simplifies the analysis of environmental data.

## Features

### ZipLoc4
- **Functionality**: Generate a snapshot of weather and air quality data based on selected locations, such as cities, zip codes, or notable landmarks.
- **Usage**: Run ZipLoc4 to collect current temperature and AQI information tailored to your areas of interest.

### LocView10
- **Functionality**: Create detailed temperature data visualizations and maps with pins marking the selected locations.
- **Usage**: Execute LocView10 to produce comprehensive graphical outputs, making it easier to understand and analyze temperature variations across different areas.

### LocViewFinalAQI
- **Functionality**: Generate an in-depth graphical output of AQI pollutant levels, providing a clear view of air quality variations.
- **Usage**: Run LocViewFinalAQI after collecting your data to visualize the specific pollutant levels, aiding in environmental analysis.

### LocView4 (Optional)
- **Functionality**: This optional module creates beautiful graphical outputs that are aesthetically pleasing and suitable for presentation.
- **Usage**: While not essential, using LocView4 enhances the visual appeal of your AQI data, making it worthy of publication or display.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the ZipLoc folder.
3. Run the appropriate scripts as described above to collect and visualize your data.

## Usage

To use ZipLoc effectively, follow the workflow:
1. **Run ZipLoc4** to gather weather and AQI data.
2. **Execute LocView10** to visualize temperature data on a map.
3. **Use LocViewFinalAQI** to produce pollutant level graphs.
4. Optionally, run **LocView4** for enhanced graphical outputs.

**NOTE: If you can't find the output files, check "MACINTOSH HD / USERS / YOUR USER NAME" - It's a little confusing at first, even for me, but it works! Keep in mind, the files from ZipLoc4 do not export until you type EXIT. Remember to type EXIT before closing the window to ensure you get your log files correctly. If you want to generate a new graphical output delete the log files or move them, and generate new data. If there are entries in the data that cause the legend to go off the page you can change the Location Name in the text file, that's almost always what is too long, especially if it includes the full address or name of a State Park for example. Let me know if you find any interesting bugs.**
